# Comparative Analysis on Programming Languages (CSADPRG MCO) Project

This project aims to support the theoretical foundations of programming languages by surveying, comparing, and evaluating the features and constructs of various languages. For this iteration, we will focus on the languages Go, Kotlin, R, and Ruby. By the end of this project, participants should have a deeper understanding of various programming paradigms, as well as an appreciation for the similarities and differences between the features of these languages.

## Task List

- [ ] **Software Application â€“ Weekly Payroll System**
    - [ ] Design and implement an automated weekly payroll system in each of the assigned languages (Go, Kotlin, R, Ruby).
    - [ ] The system should cater to the intricacies of payroll computation, including regular workdays, night shifts, holidays, and overtime.
    - [ ] Implement a menu-driven interface for the system.
    - [ ] Allow users to modify default configuration settings.
    - [ ] Implement a feature to display individual daily salaries and the total weekly salary.

- [ ] **Evaluation Paper**
    - [ ] Write a detailed discussion on the features and constructs of Go, Kotlin, R, and Ruby.
    - [ ] Include code snippets in the paper to support the discussion.
    - [ ] Discuss how specific language features aided in the implementation of the Weekly Payroll System.
    - [ ] Follow the provided format guidelines (e.g., margins, fonts, spacing) and ensure proper citations in APA format.
    - [ ] Avoid plagiarism. Ensure originality in content and cite sources appropriately.

- [ ] **Class Presentation**
    - [ ] Prepare a presentation to discuss the software application and the features of the assigned programming languages.
    - [ ] Ensure clarity and organization in the presentation.
    - [ ] Each group is allocated 20 minutes for the presentation.

- [ ] **Submission and Deliverables**
    - [ ] Submit the Language Evaluation Paper by November 25, 2023, on Canvas.
    - [ ] Ensure the paper contains all the necessary sections, including Introduction, Language Comparison, Developing the Weekly Payroll System, Conclusion, and References.
